This is the start of a package manager for Standard ML libraries.

The implementation mostly just contains stubs, but the semantic versioning
library should be helpful along the way.

Development notes:

Create a $HOME/.smackage directory.

You might like to copy doc/versions.smackspec.example to $HOME/.smackage/versions.smackspec

smack install foolib 1.0.0

Will list installation candidates, and attempt to create folders.  Eventually these two activities will have some relation to one another.
